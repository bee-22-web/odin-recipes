        Light and very buttery. The recipe does not make a large batch, but it's simple enough to make many batches.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9-inch square baking dish.</li>
        <li>Blend flour, sugar, and butter until well combined; dough will be stiff. Press into the prepared dish and prick the top all over with a fork.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until pale golden brown on the edges, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool completely before cutting into squares.</li>
